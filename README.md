⚖️ Legal Lense Your Intelligent Window into Indian Law. Legal Lense is a RAG-powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) legal assistant designed to analyze user scenarios, retrieve relevant sections from the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and generate grounded legal insights using Google Gemini 3. Designed with a high-end "Legal Workspace" aesthetic, it bridges the gap between complex legal statutes and actionable advice.
✨ Key Features
🤖 AI-Powered Legal Analysis: Uses gemini-3-flash-preview to analyze natural language scenarios and map them to specific IPC sections.
📚 RAG Architecture (Simulated): Retrieves relevant legal context ("Evidence Board") from a local IPC dataset before generating an answer, ensuring responses are grounded in actual law.
🗄️ Case Management: A dedicated sidebar to manage different legal case sessions and history.
📖 IPC Library: A searchable digital archive of Indian Penal Code sections with filtering capabilities.
🎨 Professional UI/UX: Custom "Gold & Charcoal" legal color theme. Typography optimized for readability (Fraunces & Urbanist fonts). "Verdict Box" styling for clear penalty visualization.
🔐 Auth Simulation: A polished login/signup screen for user onboarding.
🛠️ Tech Stack Frontend: React 18 (TypeScript), Vite Styling: Tailwind CSS (Custom Configuration) AI Model: Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai) Icons: Lucide React Markdown: React Markdown (for rendering legal text)
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites Node.js (v18 or higher) npm or yarn
A Google Gemini API Key (Get one at aistudio.google.com)
API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here Run the development server: code Bash npm run dev
🧠 How It Works (RAG Flow) User Input: The user describes a scenario (e.g., "My neighbor built a wall on my land..."). Retrieval: The system scans the MOCK_IPC_DATABASE (in services/legalData.ts) using a weighted keyword algorithm to find the top 3 most relevant legal sections. Augmentation: These sections are displayed on the right-hand Evidence Board and injected into the System Prompt. Generation: Google Gemini generates a structured response citing specific sections (e.g., IPC Section 441) and formatted penalties based only on the provided context.
